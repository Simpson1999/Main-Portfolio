# Main-Portfolio
With this, I plan to add a variety of projects I have worked on to showcase my skills and try to get better!

Within this portfolio, I have utilized SQL, Power BI...


1. Client and Transaction Type Comparison

Used SQL code to assist in automating Power BI visuals to update daily with new numbers.

Created a Power BI visual to explore historical difference between total profit for specific client performance, and transaction types (depreciation, commission, ect.)
