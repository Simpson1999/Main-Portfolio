# Main-Portfolio
With this, I plan to add a variety of projects I have worked on to showcase my skills and try to get better!

Within this portfolio, I have utilized SQL, Microsoft Power BI, Microsoft Excel, and Python.


1. Client and Transaction Type Comparison. SQL, Python

- Used SQL code to assist in automating Power BI visuals to update daily with new numbers

- Created a Power BI visual to explore the YOY historical difference between total profit for specific client performance, and transaction types (depreciation, commission, ect.)

2. Amazon Web Scrapper Project. Python

- Scrapped data from an Amazon product and created a Microsoft Excel table that updates the price daily while alerting me should the price fall below a certain threshold

3. Bike Project Dashboard. Excel

- Cleaned dataset from a fictional bike shop's sales, and created a dashboard to visualize the data effectively
